The source files for Aravis icons are SVG files in viewer/icons/src.

The rendering to the different sizes is done manually, in order to avoid
a build dependency on Inkscape. After you have modified one of the source
file, please don't forget to launch ../../tools/render-icon-theme.py from
the icons directory.
