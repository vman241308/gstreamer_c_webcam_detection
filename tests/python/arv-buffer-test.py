#  If you have installed aravis in a non standard location, you may need
#   to make GI_TYPELIB_PATH point to the correct location. For example:
#
#   export GI_TYPELIB_PATH=$GI_TYPELIB_PATH:/opt/bin/lib/girepositry-1.0/
#
#  You may also have to give the path to libaravis.so, using LD_PRELOAD or
#  LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
